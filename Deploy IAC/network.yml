    This template deploys a VPC, with a pair of public subnets spread 
    across two Availabilty Zones. It deploys an Internet Gateway, with a default 
    route on the public subnets.

Parameters:
  # Paramenters are entirely optional.
  # but using them will make your cloudformation templates more reusable
  # use them for things that may change over time, such as instance type,
  # VPCs and so on.

  Resources:
  # instace profile contains the IAM Role name(s) that we want to associate to our auto scaling EC2 Servers
  # never give too much permissions to your EC2 instances! if they get hacked, the permissions get hacked also!
  # in this example, I create a Role called UdacityS3ReadOnlyC2 and just give it a policy of S3 Read-Only Access
  ProfileWithRolesForOurApp:
    Type: AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile
    Properties: 
      Roles:
        - UdacityS3ReadOnlyEC2
Outputs: 
  # This is also optional.
  # Bonus points for useful outputs!
  # for example, if you create a Load Balancer
  # it's nice to output the URL to it here, so that we don't have to go to the console to get it.
